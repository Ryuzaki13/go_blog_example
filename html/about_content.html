    <h1>ABOUT</h1>
    <p>I am the daughter of God, strong & passionate & empowered, a virtuous woman. I am Proverbs 31 woman! You See I
        declare these words over my life even though I continue to face life's circumstances and reminders of my past
        hurts. Pain has a lasting impression on us, but if we recognize our authority over each pain, hurt, setback and
        disappointment we can move forward.</p>
